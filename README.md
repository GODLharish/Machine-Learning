# Machine-Learning
Machine learning models are algorithms designed to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data. Common types include supervised models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) and unsupervised models (e.g., k-means clustering, PCA). They are widely used for classification, regression, and clustering tasks.
